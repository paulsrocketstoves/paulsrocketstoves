            <h2>Custom DJ Rack Build at 12</h2>
            <p>
				Here are four photos of me back in the day, around when I was 12. I built this custom DJ rack out of my own initiative 
				and passion for creating something useful. Using scrap angle iron, nuts, and bolts my dad had lying around, 
				I worked late into the night, fueled by grit, creativity, and curiosity. I used tin snips to cut the angle iron 
				and bent it to my will, designing and crafting it with precision. Without guidance or prior knowledge, I crafted 
				a solid DJ rack that I used for several dozen DJ gigs, earning money from class reunions, weddings, dances, and more. 
				Eventually, I upgraded to new equipment and a fancier rack, but this original creation remains a testament to my drive, 
				ingenuity, and resourcefulness.
