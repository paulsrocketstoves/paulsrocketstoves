            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! My name is Paul Jackino. I'm passionate about living life fully, making meaningful connections, and becoming the best man I can be. 
                For me, life is about writing a compelling story—one filled with challenges, triumphs, adventures, and deep connections with others and the world around us.
            </p>
            <p>
                I see technology as a tool to enrich our lives, but not as the centerpiece. Instead, I value the art of storytelling, the beauty of shared experiences, 
                and the inspiration that comes from overcoming trials. These principles guide my journey of growth, creativity, and connection.
            </p>

        <!-- My Journey Section -->
        <section>
            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>
                My path has been anything but ordinary. It began with a love for DJing and radio as a young boy, pretending to host radio shows in my bedroom. By age 13, I hosted a radio show 
                at my local college station, which sparked a lifelong passion for creative expression and communication.
            </p>
            <p>
                That passion grew into a career in radio, audio production, and eventually music composition. After graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Communication 
                from SUNY Fredonia, I pursued opportunities across the country, from Phoenix, Arizona, to my hometown in New York. Along the way, I explored diverse fields, including 
                organic farming, carpentry, manufacturing, and IT. Each experience shaped me, teaching me the value of perseverance, collaboration, and community.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most notably, my entrepreneurial spirit led me to create <strong><a href="https://paulsrocketstoves.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul's Rocket Stoves</a></strong>, a venture dedicated to facilitating engagement with contained fire that inspires primal connection with nature and community. This business embodies my mission to bring people closer to nature and each other.

        <!-- What Drives Me Section -->
        <section>
            <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm driven by a deep desire to grow as a person, live with integrity, and inspire others to connect meaningfully with the world around them. 
                My mission is to pursue excellence and embrace challenges, knowing that effort and perseverance lead to the greatest satisfaction.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe technology should complement, not replace, the joys of real-world experiences. Whether it's gathering around a fire, creating music, or collaborating on 
                a project, I aim to facilitate moments of connection that are authentic, enriching, and memorable.
            </p>
