            <h2>Client Engagement & Discovery Process</h2>
            <p>
                At the young age of 12, I embarked on an entrepreneurial journey as a DJ, starting with gigs for friends and family. 
                Through self-promotion, marketing campaigns, and word-of-mouth referrals, I established a reputable DJ business, 
                serving schools, colleges, and various institutions in my community. This business was more than just playing music; 
                it was about organization, planning, and delivering exceptional service.
            </p>
            <p>
                My process began with discovery calls where I would meet clients to understand their needs, document the service 
                requirements, and formalize agreements through detailed contracts. These agreements outlined the services to be 
                delivered, payment terms, and event schedules. Over time, this process evolved from handwritten notes to 
                professionally typed contracts.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a teenager, I facilitated events like weddings, where I took on roles as an MC and event coordinator. 
                I managed ceremonial rituals such as the introduction of the wedding party, first dances, cake cutting, and 
                garter removal with precision and professionalism. I ensured every stakeholder's needs were met, executing plans 
                flawlessly and serving clients with white-glove treatment. This experience honed my skills in client engagement, 
                project management, and contract negotiationâ€”skills that are highly transferable to roles like account executive, 
                sales manager, and project manager in today's corporate world.
